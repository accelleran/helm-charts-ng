Create a default fully qualified app name.
We truncate at 63 chars because some Kubernetes name fields are limited to this (by the DNS naming spec).

We consciously differ here from the standard Helm helper template.

The standard template usually uses the release name as the full name, if it contains the chart name.
We have chosen not to do that as it has caused issues for us in the past, when subchart names are contained
within the release name.
